As the COVID-19 crisis accelerates the digitalization of finance, commerce and\\ntrade, it is likely that blockchain-related projects will continue to grow in number. The technol-\\nogy is often praised for providing distinct advantages over traditional centralized databases,\\nnotably due to blockchain’s distributed architecture, involving many public or private partici-\\npants (or nodes), which is thought to offer superior resilience, as well its security-by-design,\\ntamper-proof protocol, which its supporters believe guarantees the protection of its users’\\npersonal data and other hosted assets. As more solutions are beginning to rely on blockchain\\ntechnology, it is becoming increasingly evident that the evolution of this technology is being\\nheld back by the lack of interoperability across blockchain solutions, other systems such as\\ntraditional IT solutions, or other emerging technology.\\nThis paper reviews blockchain interoperability through the lenses of business, technol-\\nogy, security and risk, as well as legal considerations, and can be used as a reference\\nto support further work on blockchain interoperability. We summarize our exploration agen-\\nda to date, along with key lessons learned from experimenting with interoperability across\\nseveral blockchain platforms, e.g. Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Corda and Quorum.\\nOur intent is to share knowledge and promote awareness of blockchain interoperability.\\nWe identify areas where further technical development, standards and architecture pat-\\nterns are needed, and provide guidance to practitioners in building open and sustainable             5\\nblockchain solutions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExecutive Summary\\n\\x0c    ONE\\n    The Case for\\n    Blockchain\\n6\\n    Interoperability\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cThe Case for\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\nThere is no common definition of interoperability. For the purpose of this paper, the\\nfollowing definition of interoperatibility serves as a guide for the reader:\\n\\n    The ability to exchange data with other platforms, including those running different\\n    types of blockchains, as well as with the off-chain world (EU Blockchain Observatory\\n    and Forum, 2019).\\n\\nThis definition has to be understood not only at the application and technology levels, but\\nalso with respect to its business, security, and legal considerations (see Part III). Realizing\\nthe potential of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) will require focusing on interoperabil-\\nity. Breaking siloes and walled gardens of data and applications are some of the many ben-\\nefits presented by this emerging technology. However, these benefits will not materialize in\\nthe absence of interoperability among different blockchain protocols, blockchain and other\\nemerging and legacy technologies, which may well leave us with the same original problems.\\nBlockchain or distributed ledger interoperability is a complex and complicated challenge to\\ntackle. As we move towards the operationalization of this emerging technology, interopera-\\nbility will come to the fore as issue of pressing importance. The different types and designs\\n                                                                                                               7\\nof the core shared distributed ledger can be broadly classified as being either permissioned\\nand permissionless blockchain networks. Institutions and organizations have been exploring\\nDLT technology protocols on the basis of their respective needs and the requirements of the\\nchallenge statement at hand. And since multiple blockchain networks are evolving, it is now\\ncritical for these different systems not just be able to interoperate with legacy systems but\\nalso be able to communicate across different distributed ledgers. This could be more easily\\nunderstood through the presentation of a few examples:\\nCentral Banking and Digital Payments: Several central banks have begun to trial block-\\nchain for practical interoperability experiments. In 2019, the Monetary Authority of Singa-\\npore and Bank of Canada collaborated on a project to demonstrate the interoperability of\\ntwo major blockchain networks – Corda and Quorum – using Hashed Time-Locked Con-\\ntracts (HTLC).2 Project Stella (more information on the project is available in the Annex),\\nconducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of Japan (BoJ), explored how\\ncross-ledger Delivery versus Payment (DvP) can work between two individual ledgers with-\\nout a direct connection. Thailand’s central bank also worked with the Hong Kong Monetary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2   \\x07 Jasper–Ubin Design Paper Enabling Cross-Border High Value Transfer Using Distributed Ledger\\n    “\\n     Technologies,” May 2, 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                    The Case for Blockchain Interoperability\\n\\x0c    Authority (HKMA) on cross-border funds transfers using blockchain.3 With the launch of\\n    the Libra project in 2019, the conversation around stablecoins – and Central Bank Digi-\\n    tal Currency (CBDC) – has accelerated. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, which re-\\n    quired social isolation and limited face-to-face commerce, has reinforced the importance\\n    of digital payment schemes. However, various existing data standards and communica-\\n    tion protocols in payment networks, often proprietary networks, are leading to payment\\n    processing delays. Rapid change and innovation is taking place in payment technologies,\\n    which are enabling faster, cheaper, efficient domestic and cross-border payments – one of\\n    the key paradigms will be interoperability between these different channels. In the same\\n    spirit of collaborative learning, this White Paper seeks to build a better understanding on\\n    interoperability.\\n    Digital Identity: Blockchain technology has become the driving force of the so-called “de-\\n    centralized Internet Web 3.0”, which requires interoperability and scalability to enable\\n    end-users to control and share data, or settle agreements with other parties, through the\\n    Internet in a trustworthy manner.4 Digital identity cannot be locked in one platform –it\\n    needs interoperability across multiple platforms, and provide more choice to the end-user.\\n    This need has led to a concerted effort by various private sector and not-for-profit enti-\\n    ties to work towards creating open standards for digital identity. The verifiable credential\\n    framework developed by the W3C Working Group is an approach aimed at ensuring that\\n    the sharing and verification of digital credentials can operate smoothly across different un-\\n    derlying technology protocols. This will be critical for the openness that is needed in digital\\n    identity systems.\\n    Supply Chains: Interoperability is also expected to benefit the supply chain environment.\\n8   One of the key challenges in supply chain systems is the lack of interoperability between\\n    the different data systems of supply chain actors. While blockchain-based supply chains\\n    could bring various advantages to fragmented supply chain systems, its implementation\\n    will face various challenges. One of these challenges is the interoperability between dis-\\n    tributed ledgers and the existing high volume of legacy software systems, e.g. the Enter-\\n    prise Resource Planning (ERP) software system.5\\n    Healthcare: In the healthcare space, interoperability has been a challenge as a complex\\n    ecosystem of vendors, providers, regulators and patients seek to exchange and manage\\n    access to healthcare data across different systems and organizations. Healthcare Infor-\\n    mation and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) has examined how blockchain tech-\\n    nology can be leveraged to achieve on-chain and off-chain helath data interoperability.6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    3   Shen, Alice. 2019. “Thai Central Bank to Work with HKMA on Cross-Border Blockchain.” Central Bank-\\n        \\x07\\n        ing, August 6.

How-\\never, the industry recognizes that this technology is still in the early stages of adoption, and\\nthat it is continuously evolving through new experiments and improvements. In this context,\\nit is not surprising that blockchain standards are, as of today, fragmented, with uneven rep-\\nresentation from emerging economies. In a 2019 analysis of ISO/TC 307 (blockchain and\\ndistributed ledger technologies), only three African countries were members, with only one\\ncountry – South Africa – serving in a participating role.13 In the past year, that number has\\nrisen to two, with the addition of Nigeria as a participating country. Given the active work be-\\ning conducted in several African countries to explore and understand the potential of block-\\nchain, the inconsistent participation in standards groups at the national level could have im-         11\\nplications for enterprise adoption and institutional change.\\nAs more complex applications are being explored in the blockchain space, and also with-\\nin the context of interoperability, cross-chain interoperability standards are increasingly\\nneeded. The standards could also be looked according to the different layers of techni-\\ncal architecture, e.g. platforms, applications or industry-specific data exchange, wallets\\nand key management. The following framework14 highlights these different layers, which\\naddresses various initiatives and efforts by standards development organizations (SDO)\\nin DLT standards:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13   \\x07\\n     “ISO/TC 307 Participation.” ISO.

Public administration could become inefficient, costly and fragmented if cross-sys-\\ntem communication is not achieved in the digital ecosystem. The European Interoperabil-\\nity Framework highlights that a key aspect of the European ‘Digital Single Market’ is to\\n“guarantee the secure and free flow of data, develop standards and ensure interoperabili-\\nty”.20 Among the reasons for this heightened focus on achieving ICT interoperability are its\\npotential benefits, e.g. increased competition, higher innovation, and more autonomy and\\nflexibility of choice.21\\nBlockchain technology has demonstrated its benefits and potential over the years. How-\\never, many organizations are still hesitant about its value for their operations and busi-\\nnesses. The lack of interoperability contributes to some of these uncertainties. It is clear\\nthat the transfer of information from one blockchain to another is a big challenge; it is\\nalso clear that organizations are cautious about relying on one vendor, and later finding\\nthat they are unable to transfer data if they decide to switch vendors. However, in ad-\\ndition to technology interoperability, the organizations will also have to focus on busi-                             17\\nness processes that would require to align with cross-organizational trust on respective\\ngovernance and business ecosystems. An example to illustrate this challenge could be\\nblockchain-enabled and shared “Know your Customer” (KYC) utility models.22 While in-\\nteroperable blockchain systems could lower the high costs associated with KYC, it would\\nnonetheless require new commercial and governance models to emerge for sharing KYC\\nacross different financial institutions.\\nThe core underlying infrastructure of the digital economy is experiencing changes and\\nshifts due to blockchain technology, as well as other emerging technologies. However,\\nthere are challenges around standardization and interoperability, which are critical for the\\nsuccessful scaling of these potential alternative market structures. Exchanging data as-\\nsets and exchange of value in the form of digital instruments between two counterparts is\\nrelatively easy if they use the same blockchain platform. However, this is rarely the case:\\nmost businesses operate different types of blockchain technologies, making the transfer\\nof digital assets an insurmountable challenge. The value of blockchain interoperability to\\nindustry and enterprise networks is rapidly becoming evident in the context of a growing\\ndigital economy, accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis.\\n\\n\\n20   https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/isa/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf\\n21   https://cyber.harvard.edu/interop/pdfs/interop-breaking-barriers.pdf\\n22   https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2018/03/kpmg-blockchain-kyc-utility.pdf\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                        A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability\\n\\x0c     An interoperable digital architecture is now imperative for the exchange of data and digi-\\n     tal assets in the digitalization of trade, e-commerce, or e-government services. Interoper-\\n     ability also has direct implications on an organization’s business model and its strategic\\n     positioning to deliver value. Some technology providers initially might be less focused on\\n     interoperability issues, as each one would like to grab a larger part of the market, especially\\n     those reliant on network effects. The emergence of multiple new alternatives, in addition to\\n     legacy instruments, could result in further fragmentation rather than solving the challenges\\n     if the issues around standards and interoperability are not addressed through multi-stake-\\n     holder coordination. Interoperability cannot result from the efforts of a single entity, rather\\n     it requires a governance group made up of all stakeholders active in this field. This gover-\\n     nance group will administer and make decisions on business agreements, legal terms and\\n     technical feasibility. This group will also manage the data standard of interoperability, such\\n     as smart contract, entities and digital assets.23 This governance model could help to estab-\\n     lish a business partnership, which is not constricted by technological limitations.\\n\\n\\n     The Technology Perspective\\n          So far, the notion of chain interoperability has seen much theory and little practice,\\n          primarily because a live example of successful chain interoperability requires not one,\\n          but two, already existing, stable and sufficiently powerful blockchains to build off, but\\n          this is slowly starting to change. -Vitalik Buterin (2016).\\n18\\n     Technology Approaches\\n     Technically, blockchain interoperability seeks to achieve one fundamental goal, namely\\n     ensuring the integrity of both information exchanges (data exchange among business sys-\\n     tems) and value transfers (digital assets exchange, e.g. crypto, tokens). Internet protocols,\\n     such as TCP/IP and APIs, have set good examples of achieving data interoperability. How-\\n     ever, value transfer has been an application-layer concern, and not a protocol-level concern\\n     in the traditional Internet context. With blockchain becoming the “Internet of Value”,24 en-\\n     suring the integrity of value transfer across different blockchains has become a problem to\\n     address at the foundation layer, and also needs to be considered at the blockchain network\\n     protocol level as well. In addition, there are attempts to create interoperability among dif-\\n     ferent blockchains at the middleware level, e.g., blockchain-agnostic smart contracts, e.g.\\n     DAML by Digital Asset Holdings, or Quant Network’s multi-blockchain DApps (MApps).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     23   \\x07Inclusive Deployment of Blockchain for Supply Chains: Part 6 – A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability:\\n          http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_Framework_for_Blockchain_Interoperability_2020.pdf\\n     24   Ripple. 2019. “The Internet of Value: What It Means and How It Benefits Everyone.” October 25.

Oracles and Notaries\\n Oracles and notaries are trusted agents between different blockchains, or between a\\n blockchain and the off-chain world. To achieve better resiliency and to increase trust, or-\\n acles can adopt a decentralized architecture in the same manner as Chainlink.\\n\\n In a notary scheme, one or more trusted nodes agree to carry out an action on chain B\\n when some event on chain A happens (Buterin, 2016). Trusted nodes are the key to no-\\n tary schemes. One important feature of the notary scheme is its atomicity, meaning that\\n a transaction needs to be all or nothing for all participants. The notary scheme has been\\n implemented in the Atomic mode of the Interledger Protocol25 , whereby an ad hoc group\\n of notaries are selected to support the execution of each payment by confirming the suc-\\n cess or failure of the payment.\\n\\n\\n 2. Time-bound Asset Locking and Release\\n To support the exchange of value across different blockchains in a trustless mode, assets\\n can be locked on a blockchain ledger and released upon confirmation that the recipient\\n is ready to receive the asset. This has been implemented in the Universal Mode of the\\n Interledger Protocol and HTLC.\\n In the Universal Mode of the Interledger Protocol, after a chain of participants has been\\n selected for the value transfer, assets are locked on the corresponding ledger of each\\n participant. Following confirmation by the final recipient of the value, the locked value is                      19\\n released and transferred to the recipient by the operator on the last ledger. The last led-\\n ger will then provide a payment confirmation to the previous ledger, which will unlock the\\n asset and send it on, etc., until the ledger for the sender also receives the confirmation,\\n unlocks the asset, and finalizes the deduction of this asset from the sender’s account. To\\n prevent a liquidity starvation attack on any participant, all transactions are time-bound,\\n with upstream ledgers allocating more time than the downstream ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n25   Stefa Thomas & Evan Schwartz.

Blockchain A sends h to B.\\n\\n       2.\\x07\\x07Blockchains A and B both lock their asset into a smart contract with the following rules\\n          (A locks first, B locks after seeing A’s asset successfully locked).\\n          a. \\x07\\n             On A’s side, if the secret is provided by B within 2X seconds, then the asset is trans-\\n             ferred to B; otherwise, it is sent back to A.\\n          b. \\x07\\n             On B’s side, if the correct secret (i.e., the value whose hash is h) is provided within X\\n             seconds, then the asset is transferred to A; otherwise, it is sent back to B.\\n\\n       3. \\x07\\n          Blockchain A reveals the secret within X seconds to claim the asset from B’s contract.\\n          However, this also ensures that B learns the secret allowing B to claim the asset from\\n          A’s contract.\\n     Unlike in the notary scheme, hash locking does not require a pre-existing trust relationship\\n     between the two blockchains or with a third party.\\n\\n       3. Sidechains/Relays\\n       Another approach to allow different blockchains to interoperate is to have an “integra-\\n       tion” blockchain to support the exchange of value and information between different par-\\n20     ticipating blockchains.\\n       In the sidechains-relay model, the relay chain is the integration layer. It can issue a token\\n       to be used for value exchange by all sidechains. The relay chain can offer smart contracts\\n       for different sidechains to interact with and exchange information. In addition, it generally\\n       provides a larger number of validation nodes than any of the sidechains, thereby provid-\\n       ing more robust security as it ensures that no double-spend is made on value exchanges.\\n       The information integrity is preserved as long as that information is part of the overall\\n       “block header” that is: (i) generated in some cryptographically authenticated way, most\\n       likely using Merkle trees; and (ii) recorded on the relay chain.\\n       Regarding information exchange, a smart contract on the relay chain can function as a\\n       light client for a specific sidechain, thus leveraging the sidechain’s standard verification\\n       procedure to verify any block headers that have been fed into the contract. Relays are\\n       very powerful as they can be used for asset portability, atomic swaps, and many other\\n       more complex uses.\\n       For example, Polkadot uses a relay chain to connect multiple sidechains known as para-\\n       chains, with each parachain being a blockchain. The Polkadot architecture is described in\\n       detail in the latter part of this paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0c 4. Application Layer Adaptors\\n In order to facilitate the development of applications that may run on multiple block-\\n chains, an abstraction layer can be created so that the business functions of the underly-\\n ing blockchains can be exposed as common APIs.\\n A blockchain-agnostic smart contract language can be another alternative to code the\\n business logic and map the different underlying blockchain platforms. DAML is a smart\\n contract language that enables distributed application development without having to\\n decide what blockchain or distributed ledger platform to use. The creator of DAML, Dig-\\n ital Asset, is working with partners to have DAML-based applications run on Corda, Hy-\\n perLedger Fabric or Sawtooth, VMware Blockchain, and other platforms.\\n Vottun’s technology exposes blockchain-specific smart contracts as common APIs, mak-\\n ing it possible for applications to be built without having to target any particular block-\\n chain network. Each API is mapped to an underlying blockchain smart contract function,\\n which will execute on the specific blockchain. Vottun currently supports Hyperledger\\n Fabric, Alastria, Quorum, and Ethereum.\\n The Overledger platform by Quant Network, connects various blockchain networks, as\\n well as legacy systems. The platform provides a blockchain-agnostic operating system\\n for business applications to run. It currently supports Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, Ethere-\\n um, Bitcoin, IOTA, EOS, and Ripple, either permissioned or permissionless, and provides\\n Java and JavaScript SDKs for developers to develop applications to run on the platform.\\n Quant Networks uses its own Dapps technology (Multi-blockchain Dapps or MDapps).\\n LiquidApps provides a run-time middleware and developer SDK to enable the develop-                      21\\n ment of decentralized applications that can run across multiple blockchain networks. It\\n currently supports EOS, Ethereum, Telos, and sother blockchain networks.\\n\\nTechnical framework\\nThe technical methods for interoperability can be categorized across two dimensions: just-\\nin-time vs. on-going interoperability, and direct vs. third-party interoperability. In the sec-\\nond dimension, third-party can be an independent entity, e.g. a notary or oracle service\\nprovider, or a blockchain network to which the interoperating parties must belong, such as\\na sidechain or relay chain.\\n\\n\\n                           JUST-IN-TIME                       ON-GOING\\n\\n\\n  Direct                   Protocols, e.g. time-bound         Application layer adapters\\n                           asset locking and release\\n\\n\\n  Via a third party        Oracles, notaries                  Sidechain, relay-chain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                           A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability\\n\\x0c     When the team has this interoperability initiative, both value exchange and information\\n     exchange were explored technically. Blockchain is touted to be the foundation for “The\\n     Internet of Value” (or digital assets). In this exploration the exchange of value is singled\\n     out as a particularly important problem for blockchain interoperability. When it comes to\\n     exchange of information, it is referring to the scenarios where no digital assets changes\\n     hands as part of the cross-chain operation.\\n     Table 1 illustrates how two blockchains using the respective ledger technologies can\\n     exchange value or information based on current technologies.\\n\\n\\n     TABLE 1: VALUE EXCHANGE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE USABILITY BETWEEN\\n     DIFFERENT BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORMS\\n\\n       w                ETHEREUM/         CORDA               INTERLEDGER        POLKADOT                HYPERLEDGER\\n                        QUORUM                                                                           FABRIC\\n\\n\\n       Ethereum/        Value: HTLC      Value: HTLC         Value:              Value &                Value & Information:\\n       Quorum           Infor.: Oracle   Infor.: oracle26    Application         Information:           Application\\n                                                             layer adapter       Application            layer adaptor27\\n                                                                                 layer adapter\\n\\n       Corda                             Value & Infor-      N/A                 Value & Informa-       Value & Informa-\\n                                         mation: Corda                           tion: Application      tion: Application\\n                                         Network as the                          layer adapter (to      layer adaptor\\n22                                       relay chain.                            be developed)\\n\\n       Interledger                                                               N/A                    Value: Application\\n                                                                                                        Layer Adapter\\n\\n       Polkadot                                                                  (There is only one     Value & Information:\\n                                                                                 Polkadot network)      Application layer\\n                                                                                                        adapter\\n                                                                                                        (to be developed)\\n\\n       Hyperledger                                                                                      Value: HTLC\\n       Fabric                                                                                           Infor.: oracles,\\n                                                                                                        Events API, Joint\\n                                                                                                        network or channels\\n\\n     Note: The shaded cells repeat the same information as in the right side of the diagonal line of the matrix(table).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     26    \\x07\\n           Wan, Clemens. 2019. “Unlocking Corda Ethereum Interoperability Pt 3.” Medium.

In cases of information exchange, i.e. how each blockchain interprets the data, this may\\n     need to be coordinated off-chain. Similarly, when tokens are exchanged between blockchains,\\n     the “exchange rate” between two different tokens may need to be determined off-chain, unless\\n     there is an oracle for that exchange rate.\\n\\n\\n     The Security and Risk Perspective\\n     Blockchain projects employ different trust models. Public blockchains build trust based\\n     on cryptography, consensus algorithms and incentive models, e.g. proof-of-work and the\\n     considerable costs associated with attacking a network’s data integrity. Their security\\n     strength typically correlates to the number of nodes on the network. Blockchains rely heav-\\n     ily on membership management and traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to provide\\n     trust on the network. Their security mostly hinges on the established business relationship\\n     among the participants.\\n     When two blockchains interoperate, it is important to analyze the difference in their security\\n     models and introduce necessary compensating controls so that the integrity of information\\n     or value exchange would not be compromised for the two interoperating blockchains. This re-\\n     quires careful design of the interoperability interface. A good example is the way parachains\\n     leverage the strength of the relay chain in Polkadot.\\n     For information exchange, the critical security issue is the integrity and trustworthiness\\n     of the information from another chain or system. The 2019 Oracle attack on the cryp-\\n24\\n     to-asset platform Synthetic resulted in the loss of 37 million digital tokens within several\\n     hours, exemplifies this issue.33\\n     For value exchange, the key issues include: (i) the integrity of the information; (ii) the asset\\n     ownership and its intended action; and (iii) the value exchange’s execution being fair and\\n     atomic. The fairness ensures that both parties would get their part of the exchange, and no\\n     party should have an advantage in backing out of the transaction based on external events.\\n     A condition for interoperability resides in the ability for two systems to recognize each other’s\\n     identity schemes. Aiming for a common identity management is unrealistic, as they are intrin-\\n     sically linked to each chains’ cryptographic choices. On the other hand, one precondition for\\n     establishing trust is to establish some sort of mapping across identity schemes.\\n     From a risk perspective, a party may take on additional risks if it interoperates with another par-\\n     ty from a platform with a lower security and risk profile.

Current legal frameworks for blockchain cover both the inputs and the out-\\ncomes of the technology but not the technology itself. Blockchain interoperability could\\nyield additional layers of regulatory scrutiny as it will inevitably involve different jurisdic-\\ntions; explorations will assist regulators better understand the technology.\\n  Interoperability describes the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and\\n  make use of information.\\nThe two main aspects to take into account in blockchain interoperability are the technolo-\\ngies involved and the legal dimensions. The technological aspects may be easier to over-\\ncome. This can be illustrated by how emails evolved from once being limited to exchang-\\ning messages within the same email network to now being able to exchange messages\\nacross different email networks. Overcoming the technological gap to bridge interop-\\nerability is inevitable. It is already moving forward in the realm of cryptocurrencies.34\\nThe legal aspects might be more challenging as the many existing legal frameworks reg-\\nulating the same or similar purposes are already giving rise to conflicts, without adding\\ntechnology in the mix. It is not necessarily the medium of technology but its purpose and\\nimplications which has surfaced the tensions with existing frameworks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34   \\x07\\n     See Magas, Julia, “Crypto interoperability evolves: From blockchain bridges to DeFi transfers”, at https://\\n     cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-interoperability-evolves-from-blockchain-bridges-to-defi-transfers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                         A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability\\n\\x0c     If two or more systems are exchanging information, the purpose of that exchange will drive\\n     which laws may apply. For example, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United\\n     States regulated investments, “in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they\\n     are called”. Thus, as the Act points out the name of the instrument doesn’t matter, what\\n     matters is its nature. This was emphasized by panelists35 at the first panel on “Virtual Cur-\\n     rencies” at the CFTC TAC Meeting of 3 October 2019. Below are some of those key points:\\n       1. it is important to focus on the functions and features of the digital asset/stablecoin;\\n          as with any investment, there is a need to understand the nature of the instrument,\\n       2.\\xa0\\x07\\n           so one can assess the value, how to use it, and how to regulate it;\\n          it is important to look at the different types of stablecoins and identify what their\\n       3. \\x07\\n          nature really is, regardless of what they are called/named; and\\n          the value of FINMA’s principle of “same risks, same rules” set forth on its recent\\n       4. \\x07\\n          guidance on stablecoin.\\n     None of this, however, minimizes the complexities of trying to identify an instrument under\\n     the current regulatory environment. Such identification remains a challenge as it is impact-\\n     ed by, for example: (i) small permutations on the instrument; (ii) by the jurisdiction where\\n     the instrument is to be considered; and/or (iii) how the instrument is marketed since its\\n     issuance may have different purposes in different places, and therefore classifying it as a\\n     different instrument at different times. And this is just one example in one industry and in\\n     one country.\\n26   Thus, the main legal question to ask before even considering the technical interoperability\\n     of a proposed blockchain application is the exact purpose of the proposed blockchain ap-\\n     plication. Teams need to look beyond mere labels and:\\n       A. \\x07\\n          analyze the essential characteristics of the proposed application to determine what it\\n          really is and, thus, what industry it relates to and what laws, regulations and/or com-\\n          pliance requirements may apply;\\n       B. \\x07\\n          consider how it may impact market competitiveness as it may raise anti-trust issues\\n          depending on what it is going to do.\\n     Depending on the purpose of the blockchain application and the jurisdictions involved,\\n     there may be as many commonalities as there are divergences in laws and regulations.\\n     These may impose different requirements that may need to be implemented through\\n     technological controls, and which may subsequently impact the technical aspect\\n     of interoperability.\\n     The wide range of possible blockchain applications remain largely unregulated. In the\\n     meantime, relevant industry laws and regulations apply, regardless of the technology being\\n     used. For example: (i) financial laws will apply to blockchain applications for financial ser-\\n     vices; (ii) health and drug regulations will apply to blockchain applications used for health\\n     and drugs; (iii) consumer protection laws may also apply depending on the issue that arise\\n\\n\\n     35   The panelists included Gary DeWaal, Special Counsel, Chair, Financial Markets and Regulator; Katten\\n          \\x07\\n          Muchin Rosenman LLP; and Lee Schneider, General Counsel, block.one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cfrom the use of a blockchain application, etc. Current laws on cybersecurity, financial ser-\\nvices, privacy and data protection, money transfers or transmission licensing, to name but\\na few, can and should, certainly apply to any technology.\\n\\n\\nLessons from cryptocurrency\\nCryptocurrencies have conferred celebrity status to blockchain technology. However, in\\nsome cases it challenges the sovereign control of the state in issuing currencies. Reg-\\nulating cryptocurrency became a necessity due to its potential impact in banking and\\nfinancial markets. A 2018 PWC survey of 600 executives in 15 countries reported that\\n48 percent of respondents considered that regulatory uncertainty is the most important\\nbarrier to blockchain adoption.36\\nAbout 130 countries and some regional organizations have issued laws or policies on\\ncryptocurrencies.37 Out of 130 countries, nine have an absolute ban on cryptocurrencies,\\nwhile 16 countries have banned it an implicitly.38 While China and Lithuania implicitly ban\\ncryptocurrencies, they nonetheless are among 13 countries that have or are issuing na-\\ntional or regional cryptocurrencies.39 While countries such as Belarus, the Cayman Is-\\nlands, Luxembourg and Spain, do not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender, they\\nsee a potential in the technology behind it and are developing a cryptocurrency-friend-\\nly regulatory regime to attract investment in technology companies.40 Yet others accept\\ncryptocurrency as a means of payment, even by government agencies, as in the case of\\nthe Swiss Canton of Zug and a municipality in the Canton of Ticino.41 The Isle of Man and\\nMexico also allow the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment alongside their na-                            27\\ntional currency; Antigua and Barbuda allows the funding of projects and charities through\\ngovernment-supported ICOs.42\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n36   PWC, Blockchain is here.

Legal considerations on blockchain technology\\nmay be amplified depending on whether the blockchain is public or private, permissionless\\nor permissioned. This is because on a public and permissionless blockchain environment\\nthe decentralized nature of blockchain raises prominent legal concerns relating to the li-\\nability, jurisdiction, applicable law, rights and obligations of its different actors, to name\\nbut a few. In such an environment, actions and decision-making are likely to be spread out\\ngeographically among numerous nodes located in different locations, as well as among\\nparties that may not be readily identifiable, if even possible to identify them in the first in-\\nstance. The inability to control illicit activities and malicicous actors, and identify responsi-\\nbility of the network poses a challenge. For instance, the WannaCry ransomware attack in\\nMay 2017 demanded payment in Bitcoins. By receiving Bitcoin payments it is not possible\\nto know who owns those Bitcoins, even if the transaction has been executed in a public and\\npermissionless blockchain.51\\n\\nThe legal issues in a public and permissionless blockchain are clear:\\n     a. \\x07\\n        Who is responsible for harm in a blockchain environment? Should it be the node oper-\\n        ators who are running the network, or the software developer, i.e. the one who codified\\n        the blockchain rules and/or protocols; or some other party?\\n     b. Who has legal personality in a blockchain?\\n     c. Which law applies since the “decision-makers” are in different locations?                                     29\\n     d. \\x07\\n        Which jurisdiction has authority to hear and consider disputes in light of the different\\n        locations of all involved in a blockchain?\\n\\nFor now, these questions remain mostly unanswered. Courts will have to decide these is-\\nsues when they come before them at some future date and challenges are mounted against\\nthe blockchain technology itself.\\nBroadly speaking, identifying the actors is easier in a private and permissioned block-\\nchain as it is privately owned and those on the blockchain are participating thanks to\\nsomeone’s permission to do so. There is control in a private and permissioned blockchain,\\nwhich makes it less problematic from a legal point of view. As private and permissioned,\\none easily knows who controls the blockchain, who has access, where it is located (even\\nif in different locations), who acts and makes decisions on the blockchain. Being able to\\nidentify who has control of a blockchain makes it possible to determine which jurisdiction\\nwould have authority over a dispute, which law applies, and who may be responsible. This\\nis not to say that some of the broader questions disappear if the blockchain is private and\\npermissioned, rather it may make it easier to identify the actors in a public and permis-\\nsionless blockchain. Knowing the nature of the blockchain thus helps narrow down the\\nlegal questions one should consider when working with blockchain technology.\\n\\n\\n51    “As with all such wallets, their transactions and balances are publicly accessible even though the\\xa0cryptocur-\\n      \\x07\\n      rency wallet\\xa0owners remain unknown”, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                        A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability\\n\\x0c     Any business considering a blockchain application must have clarity on:\\n\\n       1.\\t What type of blockchain is desirable?

The team implemented a token swap using HTLC between two differ-\\nent Ethereum networks, and value transfer using Interledger protocol between Ethereum\\ntestnet and XRP Ledger testnet. The team also looked at the Polkadot’s interoperability\\ncapability between blockchain networks and legacy systems, as well as Corda’s example\\nof integrating with financial systems on issuing obligation and settlement. Additionally, the\\nteam tried and implemented two interoperability methods for a project involving sovereign/\\nnational governments.\\nA technical perspective of the explorations and lessons learned is presented below:\\n\\n1. Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC)\\nAn HTLC is a conditional transfer of value from a “depositor” to a “recipient” in which two\\ndistinct conditions prevent immediate execution. The hashlock requires the proper “secret”\\n                                                                                                      33\\nto be presented to the blockchain before the timelock expiration; if this does not occur, the\\nvalue automatically returns to the “depositor.”\\nThis allows two parties to exchange assets on independent platforms without a trusted\\nintermediary and securely, and thus enables Atomic Cross-Chain Swaps (ACCS), among\\nother useful functionalities.\\nDuring hands-on exploration, HTLCs for Ethereum native tokens swapping was explored\\nbetween two Ethereum networks. Firstly, the team tried this effort between Ganache and\\npublic Ethereum testnet Ropsten. The HTLC was deployed to both networks and conduct\\nthe token swap (see Figure 4).\\nFor detail of this exploration, please refer to this link: https://github.com/GOOGZHOU/\\nhtlc-lc-eth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t                      Working Group Explorations and Lessons Learned\\n\\x0c        FIGURE 4: HTLC EXPLORATION PROCESS FLOW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cAdditionally, the team explored the token swap on a Blockchain-as-a-service platform. This\\nservice supports atomic swap, HTLC, and cross-token swapping. During the exploration,\\ntwo kinds of native tokens were generated in a private Ethereum network, and swapped\\nwithin the locked time.\\nFrom these hands-on explorations on HTLCs, we learned that there is no need for a third\\nparty to accomplish the transaction. This aligns with the requirement to interoperate\\nwithout the need of a trusted intermediary. However, there are some assumptions and\\nconditions to accomplish HTLCs. One is that this relies on the two parties verifying the\\nsmart contracts independently on both networks. Another one is that it still needs offline\\ncommunication on the timelocks set in the smart contract. The second party must set the\\ntimelock and conclude the transaction ahead of the timelock set by the first party. During\\nthis time, the assets or payments are locked and no party is able to move the assets or\\npayments. If the transation is a large one, it will generate a low-liquidity issue in reality,\\nand would thus require an efficient communication between two parties for transactions\\nto exchange digital assets.\\nA key recommendation going forward would be to develop a new technique, or method to\\nsupport messaging across different blockchain networks.\\n\\n2. Interledger\\nInterledger is an open protocol, originally inspired by the Internet Protocol, for sending\\npayments across various blockchain networks. It enables the exchange of value across dif-\\nferent payment networks. Using Interledger, the XRP can be sent to someone who wants to\\nreceive ETH or USD can be sent to someone who wants to receive EUR. 52                                   35\\n\\nInterledger routes packets of value in the same way as the Internet routes packets of in-\\nformation. Computers on the Interledger network are called nodes. Nodes can take one or\\nmore of the following roles: sender, router, and receiver (see Figure 5).\\n\\nFIGURE 5: INTERLEDGER NODES EXAMPLES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Interledger Overview\\n\\n\\n\\n52   \\x07 nterledger. 2020. “Interledger Overview.” Accessed June 23, 2020.

One engine can manage several accounts and set-\\n     tle with many ledgers.\\n     The team tried to run three Interledger nodes connected to two blockchain testnets (Ethe-\\n     reum and Ripple XRPL: Party A, Interledger (acting as an intermediary node), and Party\\n     B. Party A sent Ether and Party B’s node received XRP, while a the third node acted as\\n     intermediary during the token exchange. To accomplish this, Party A with Ether needs to in-\\n     stall a settlement engine to transfer Ether from Ethereum testnet to the intermediary node\\n     through settlement engine for ETH (see Figure 6).\\n\\n     FIGURE 6: INTERLEDGER EXPLORATION PROCESS FLOW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Source: the working group\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cThe Interledger project working team claims to create an “Internet of Value”. This is a very\\npromising for the payment domain. The Interledger team already developed several settle-\\nment engines for different types of non-crypto payment, such as PayPal and mobile money.\\n\\n3. Polkadot\\nPolkadot is built for a scalable, interoperable and secure blockchain network. It allows partic-\\nular blockchains to interact with each other in a secure way. Polkadot uses the Relay Chain to\\nsend message between blockchains in its ecosystem and host a group of parachains which\\nrun their own applications. Below are the high-level architectures,53 which demonstrate the\\nbasic concept of relay chain and parachain (see Figure 7).\\nRelay Chain is the main chain of the system. Parachains generate blocks for validators on the\\nRelay Chain before the blocks are validated and added to the finalized chain. Thus, the Relay\\nChain provides security guarantees. Different parachains can run parallel transactions with-\\nout interference, resulting in Polkadot being potentially more scalable than a current PoS\\nsystem (see Figure 8).\\n\\nFIGURE 7: PIECES OF POLKADOT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                            37\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: An Introduction to Polkadot\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n53   \\x07 olkadot. 2020. “An Introduction to Polkadot.” April.

The lessons learnt in this exploration are that Polkadot:\\n     •\\t Gives developers flexible options to do the implementation in a modular way.\\n     •\\t Provides plenty of tools that help develop the blockchains fast.\\n        \\x07 n its current status, even though it makes the development easy, it is still difficult to com-\\n     •\\t I\\n        pare it with Ethereum which already has gained substantial momentum. Substrate re-\\n        quires developers to have specific skills, such as Ink!, smart contract language program-\\n        ming applications, such as the rust programming language.\\n\\n\\n     Substrate provides an interesting option known as “off-chain workers,” which integrates a\\n     blockchain node with existing systems. This option is similar to using oracles, but the off-\\n     chain workers provide a better alternative, especially with respect to security, scalability\\n     and infrastructure efficiency. Off-chain workers allow execution of long-running and pos-\\n     sibly non-deterministic tasks, e.g. Web requests, that would require longer than the block\\n     execution time. Off-chain workers have their own Wasm execution environment outside of\\n     the substrate runtime and they can also be initiated from the substrate runtime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cSome examples of off-chain workers can be found at https://github.com/tomusdrw/\\nsub0-offchain-workshop     and     https://github.com/jimmychu0807/substrate-off-\\nchain-pricefetch\\n\\n4. Corda Network Issuing Obligations and Settling with Cash\\nThe Corda platform can be used to issue, transfer and settle obligations through its defined\\ncontracts and API integrations. To settle an obligation with cash, the issuer of the obliga-\\ntion would require having Bank APIs integration for the issuer itself, and have a mapping\\nof bank accounts where the obligations will be settled. The idea for this exploration was to\\nunderstand how this process would work, and develop some foundational knowledge to\\npotentially further explore the Corda Token SDK. This exploration does not demonstrate\\ncross-chain interoperability as this is not settling obligations across two different block-\\nchains. However, it demonstrates potential integration with legacy financial institutions,\\nor legacy payment rails through APIs and settling on-chain obligations. The APIs were not\\nused in the demonstration, but cash and obligations were issued and settled on the Corda\\nnetwork. The team believes that there is a potential of further explorations on Corda Asset\\nencumbrance, Corda token SDK, and Corda Settler.\\n\\n5. Multilateral Sovereign and Trade Blockchain Project (WBG)\\nThe multilateral sovereign and trade blockchain project at the WBG is an effort to ex-\\nplore the potential of Blockchain and qualify it as the go-to technology to address and\\ncircumvent challenges associated with multilateral agreements. We demonstrated the\\nmanagement of multilateral agreements by leveraging two separate Blockchain plat-\\nforms, namely the core chain and the service chain. These are described as under-                     39\\n\\n Multilateral Sovereign Blockchain (Core Chain) This network includes national or sov-\\n ereign entities. For the purpose of this project, we have simulated the participation of\\n China, Indonesia and Malaysia in the wider context of an FTA between ASEAN countries\\n and China. These countries are represented by a node each and leverage the network to\\n record multilateral agreements. The platform of choice in this case is Corda.\\n\\n Trade Blockchain (Service Chain) Here, we have simulated participation from the buy-\\n er (in Indonesia), the supplier (in China), the transit hub (Malaysia), the respective sea-\\n ports and the freight forwarder. For the sake of simplicity, both the buyer and supplier\\n operate from two separate member accounts on the first node, the freight forward-\\n er operates via a member account on the second node and the seaports operate via\\n member accounts on the third node. The Blockchain platform used here is Ethereum\\n (private instance).\\n\\nThe reference architecture for these Blockchain networks is as illustrated below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t                      Working Group Explorations and Lessons Learned\\n\\x0c     FIGURE 9: REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cIn Phase 1, the main purpose of the core chain was to track trade and transit agreements\\nbetween participating nations (China, Indonesia and Malaysia). The trade agreements\\nspecified preferential tariff rates for certain goods over a given period of time, and a limit\\non the quantity. Similarly, a multilateral agreement covering, among others, transit ar-\\nrangements allows for goods to be transported via the ports of a given country. Although\\nmultiple nations can be part of this network, only the ones involved in a given trade or\\ntransit agreement are privy to the details of an agreement.\\nAs the name suggests, the service chain is intended to implement services, such as the\\nsupply chain, trade finance and payments, while also governed by multilateral agree-\\nments. For this project, we have taken an end-to-end procure to pay flow between the\\nbuyer and supplier to demonstrate the service layer application. One of the key features\\nthat allows for such governance and adherence to multilateral agreements is the interop-\\nerability between the two platforms. This was achieved that using Orchestrator service\\nat the API layer, as explained below.\\n\\nFIGURE 10: ORCHESTRATOR AS AN APPLICATION ADAPTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                       41\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe architecture deployed to achieve this can be divided into three logical components:\\n(i) Corda nodes and API in the core chain; (ii) the Ethereum nodes and API of the service\\nchain; and (iii) the Orchestrator, which is a Java application. The trigger for validation is\\ninitiated by the supplier on the UI screen, this event makes an API call to the node service\\non Ethereum with the relevant PO details. The node service, in turn, makes a call to the\\nOrchestrator application. Upon receiving the data, the Orchestrator will make an API call\\nto the web server corresponding to the Corda node that represents China. Next, the Web\\nserver makes an internal RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) to the node’s vault to retrieve\\ntrade and transit agreement for a two-way match with the PO data. The response is car-\\nried back via the web server to the Orchestrator, and subsequently to the node service on\\nthe Ethereum chain. Depending upon the response received, the smart contract for the\\ngiven PO updates its state to either ‘Accepted’ or ‘Invalid’.\\nIn Phase 2, we employed Verifiable Credentials (VC) to demonstrate direct integration\\namongst two different blockchain platforms (see Figure 11). In this context, the client\\nblockchain platform requests data from the counterpart blockchain platform and re-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t                       Working Group Explorations and Lessons Learned\\n\\x0c     ceives it in form of a VC, thereby ensuring the correctness and authenticity of data\\n     without any dependency on external entities and systems, such an orchestrator. A VC\\n     is a data structure that contains credential metadata made up of information on the\\n     credential itself, e.g. issuer information, issuance date, etc. A set of claims are issued\\n     by the issuer with regards to a subject. This information is combined with the proof\\n     identifying the issuer, and ensures that the verifier of the credential can verify the\\n     authenticity of the credential.\\n\\n     FIGURE 11: VERIFIABLE CREDENTIAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n42\\n     To use a VC, an issuer issues a verifiable claim to the holder. The holder presents the\\n     verifiable claim to the verifier. The verifier then checks the verifiable claim (see Figure 12).\\n\\n     FIGURE 12: VERIFIABLE CLAIMS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     The issuer issues a VC to the holder. The holder can then present the VC to any verifier\\n     who needs to verify the claim(s) being made by the holder pertaining to the subject of the\\n     VC. The verifier can independently verify the VC.\\n\\n     To use VCs, each network node should have the following capabilities:\\n       1.\\t Accept data in the form of VC;\\n       2.\\t VCs issued by trusted issuers; and\\n       3.\\t Provide output in the form of a VC;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cThe usage of verifiable claims is demonstrated through the interaction between the Malay-\\nsian Port on the service chain with the Malaysian node on the core chain. The goods pass\\nthrough the Malaysian port which acts as a transit hub, before it reaches the buyer based\\nout of Indonesia. To ensure that the goods being transported are in line with the agreed\\nupon transit agreement between the three nations, the Malaysian Port issues a request for\\ntransit agreement data in the form of a VC to the Malaysian sovereign node, and then ver-\\nifies the validity of the transit agreement residing on the Malaysian sovereign node. Upon\\nreceiving a positive response on parameters, such as tariffs, product code, validity, etc.,\\nthe goods are forwarded to the shipping line for further transportation.\\nTable 4 summarizes the technical explorations of blockchain interoperability by this\\nworking group.\\n\\n\\nTABLE 4: SUMMARY OF WBG’S TECHNICAL EXPLORATION OF\\nBLOCKCHAIN INTEROPERABILITY\\n\\n APPROACH          PROJECT                   BLOCKCHAINS INVOLVED              GOAL\\n\\n\\n Oracle/Notary     Interledger PoC           Ethereum and Ripple               Value Exchange\\n\\n\\n                   Multilateral Blockchain   Corda and Ethereum                Information\\n                   Phase 2                                                     Exchange\\n\\n\\n Sidechain/Relay   Polkadot PoC              Polkadot                          Information               43\\n                                                                               Exchange\\n\\n\\n Time-bound        HTLC PoC – 1              Private Ethereum                  Value Exchange\\n Asset Locking                               and public Ethereum\\n and Release\\n                   HTLC PoC – 2              Two private Ethereum networks     Value Exchange\\n\\n\\n Application       Corda Settler             Corda & Legacy                    Value Exchange\\n Layer Adapter\\n                   Multilateral Blockchain   Corda and Ethereum                Information\\n                   Phase 1                                                     Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t                         Working Group Explorations and Lessons Learned\\n\\x0c     FIVE\\n     Concluding\\n     Thoughts and\\n44\\n     Implications for\\n     International\\n     Development\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cConcluding Thoughts\\nand Implications for\\nInternational Development\\nThis White Paper has shown that blockchain interoperability is about sharing data (value\\nand information) across different blockchain networks and legacy systems. Blockchain\\ninteroperability is seeing some important experimentation by central banks and technol-\\nogy providers in cross-border payment areas. However, there are many other use cases\\nthat will depend on having interoperability. For instance, with support from the Ministry\\nof Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the\\nWBG has explored the role of Fintech in economic development, especially with respect\\nto financial inclusion. They looked at how smart contracts (one of the highly important\\nblockchain capabilities) can be leveraged in a wide range of microfinance transactions\\ncovering supply chain finance, insurance and consumer credit. 54 In the exploration, one\\nof the key takeaways in effective smart contract deployment is the need for large-scale\\nconnectivity with an external data source; the blockchain based smart contracts need\\nto interoperate with legacy systems for getting its data inputs in a reliable and secure\\nway. This case reveals the need of interoperability across different organizational infra-                 45\\nstructures and data sources. The framework highlighted in this White Paper makes it\\nclear that a governance group is needed to oversee data sharing, monitor interoperabil-\\nity standards from standard-setting bodies, refer to the technical framework to find an\\nappropriate approach, and examine security and legal framework to check the design\\nand implementation.\\nThe global supply chain is said to have a lot of potential in leveraging emerging technol-\\nogies, such as AI, Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). The COVID-19 pandemic\\nhas also brought the issue of cross-supply chain communications into focus. However,\\nthe lack of connectivity of IoT devices and Blockchain systems have become barriers\\nbecause of the absence of common standards and interoperability. 55 These challenges\\nrelating to standards will need to be resolved by standard-setting bodies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n54   \\x07 orld Bank. 2020. “Smart Contract Technology and Financial Inclusion.” Open Knowledge Re-\\n     W\\n     pository.

The success\\n     would depend on how these could be operationalized by the country government either\\n     to complement their financial management systems or become an alternative to frag-\\n     ile and lease developed countries for their financial management and procurement sys-\\n     tems. Concerned stakeholders include donors, the World Bank, governments, project\\n     intermediaries, suppliers and contractors, and ultimately the beneficiaries. In addition to\\n     this, there is another exploration of blockchain-enabled e-procurement systems which\\n     is looking into modernizing and making the procurement systems more efficient. Going\\n     forward, there might be a need for these two different systems to be able to have data\\n     exchanged across chains and be able to interact with each other.\\n     Interoperability can be a complex issue because it is needed between different instanc-\\n     es of the same blockchain platform, between different blockchain platforms, and then,\\n     of course, between those blockchain platforms and remaining systems with legacy inter-\\n     faces. With blockchain systems, interoperability is more difficult, as it is significantly dif-\\n     ferent than existing isolated data environments where you can agree on the transfer of\\n     data. Blockchain entails more than this as it involves transfering state and provenance,\\n     which is much more complex than simply the data fields. Is it about data provenance or\\n     about control flow? In fact, it covers all of these. The idea of a heterogonous future state\\n     with more than one tech platform is inevitable. Ensuring they can work together is key.\\n46   How to validate something from one blockchain to another blockchain is important.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cGlossary\\nBITCOIN\\nBlockchain protocol developed by Satoshi Nakamoto\\n\\n\\nBLOCKCHAIN\\nA ledger where data is organized into blocks linked by a cryptographic hash\\n\\n\\nCONSENSUS MECHANISM\\nA mechanism that verifies that the information that is placed in a blockchain is valid\\n\\n\\nCRYPTOGRAPHY\\nTechnique for secure communication\\n\\n\\nDIGITAL SIGNATURES\\nMathematical scheme to verify the authenticity of digital messages or documents\\n\\n\\nENCRYPTION\\nEncoding message in such a way that only authorized parties can access it                      47\\n\\n\\nETHEREUM\\nDecentralized platform for application that are expected to run exactly as programmed\\n\\n\\nFORK\\nA split in a blockchain that results in the formation of a new chain\\n\\n\\nHASH\\nCryptographic hash function used in the verification of the authenticity of data\\n\\n\\nHYPERLEDGER\\nA multi-project open source collaborative effort hosted by The Linux Foundation,\\ncreated to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                Gloassary\\n\\x0c     MINING\\n     Process of adding a record to a blockchain ledger\\n\\n\\n     NODES\\n     A device on a blockchain network\\n\\n\\n     PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK\\n     A network made of computers that are connected to each other whole being\\n     equally privileged\\n\\n\\n     PROOF-OF-WORK\\n     A technique for combatting e-mail spam by requiring proof of computational effort\\n\\n\\n     SMART CONTRACT\\n     Autonomous agent that live within the Ethereum execution environment of virtual\\n     machine.

Addressing the cost and slow execution of cross-border\\npayments and settlement has been a major motivation for projects, such as Bitcoin, Rip-\\nple or Libra, as well as some central bank-led projects on wholesale CBDC interoperabil-\\nity, e.g. Ubin, Jasper or Stella. From a technology perspective, the main issues with the\\ncurrent systems include the lack of standardized payment status capability, incompati-\\nble real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems that don’t operate 24/7, and reliance on\\ntoo many intermediaries operating with their legacy systems. Central banks have start-\\ned to study both retail and wholesale Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), and other\\nrapid payment and settlement systems (e.g. TIPS in Europe).\\nCentral banks have also collaborated across their various wholesale CBDC projects to\\nstudy the question of interoperability. In the paper “Cross-Border Interbank Payments        51\\nand Settlements paper” 1 and Jasper-Ubin (2019) 2, the authors explained how wholesale\\nCBDC coupled with the use of blockchain could address most of the cross-border pay-\\nments pain points.\\n\\n\\nMODEL 3C: A SINGLE, UNIVERSAL W-CBDC BACKED BY A BASKET\\nOF CURRENCIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: Cross-Border Interbank Payments and Settlements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                           Appendix One\\n\\x0c     Project Jasper (Bank of Canada)\\n     Project Jasper started as an initiative in March 2016 between the Bank of Canada, R3\\n     Lab and Research, Payments Canada, and other domestic financial institutions. All\\n     parties sought together as an industry to study DLT for interbank payments in Canada.\\n     Since the initiation of Project Jasper, there have been three phases of experimentation\\n     contributing to the development of a proof of concept leveraging wholesale central bank\\n     digital currency (W-CBDC) and DLT for interbank payment settlements.\\n\\n     Jasper Phase I: Project Jasper Primer (March 2016 to June 2016)\\n     This collaborative public-private research initiative aimed to understand how DLT could\\n     transform the wholesome payments system. An Ethereum-based interbank transfer pro-\\n     totype was developed at this phase. The goals were described as follows 3:\\n       “Build a proposal for a central bank-issued digital currency, including issuance, trans-\\n       fer, settlement, and destruction.\\n       Leverage rapid prototyping to test and validate the business, operational and techni-\\n       cal hypotheses.”\\n\\n     The Bank of Canada has also tested digital depository receipts (DDR) as a digital rep-\\n     resentation of Canadian currency in 2016 and 2017. In the context of Project Jasper,\\n     DDRs took the form of “CADcoin” issued by the Bank of Canada to better understand\\n     the potential impacts of blockchain technology on financial market infrastructure (FMI).\\n\\n     Jasper Phase II (December 2016 to April 2017)\\n     Building on the learning outcomes of Phase I, Phase II focused on rebuilding the plat-\\n52   form using an alternative form of DLT to test further the efficiency of this technology for\\n     the clearing and settlements of high-value interbank systems. 4 Jasper, therefore, transi-\\n     tioned to a Corda DLT platform, which consequently introduced the “notary node” con-\\n     cept at the core of its consensus protocol. This platform was exclusively built in a test\\n     environment only, and there was no integration with external systems.\\n     The Phase II platform was built to accommodate multiple settlement options. The two\\n     settlement options by the platform are the “atomic” option and the liquidity-saving mech-\\n     anism (LSM) option. This mechanism allows participants to coordinate their payments to\\n     reduce liquidity needs, through batches of queues payments. 5 Netting promotes funding\\n     efficiency and enables a smoother intraday flow of payments.\\n     A key conclusion of Jasper Phase II was that the material benefits of a DLT-based finan-\\n     cial system might be realizable if the scope of the DLT system included the settlement of\\n     multiple assets.\\n\\n     Jasper Phase III: Securities Settlement using DLT\\n     Jasper Phase III explored the potential benefits of integrating this “cash on ledger” with\\n     other assets, such as foreign exchange and securities. By extending Phase II’s proof\\n     of concept, it now allowed for immediate cleaning and delivery-versus-payment settle-\\n     ments, demonstrating the possibility of completing post-trade settlement on a DLT plat-\\n     form. The ability to settle transactions immediately significantly reduces counterparty\\n     risk and frees up collateral.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cProject Ubin.

Like Jasper and Ubin, Project Stella was developed through\\ndevelopment phases.\\n\\nStella Phase I and II\\nIn Project Stella’s Phase I, the BOJ and the ECB conducted experiments to determine\\n“whether specific existing functionalities of their respective payment systems could\\nbe run in a DLT environment in an efficient and safe manner”. In Phase II, project Stella\\nsought to gain practical understanding of DvP functioning on DLT thanks to prototypes\\ndeveloped on three different DLT platforms: Corda, Elements and Hyperledger Fabric.\\nReports indicate that “DvP can run in a DLT environment subject to the specificities of\\nthe different DLT platforms”. Depending on the use case, the design of DvP can be in-\\nfluenced by a number of factors, including “the interaction of the DvP arrangement with\\nother post-trade infrastructures.7\\nThey concluded that DLT offers a new approach for achieving DvP between ledgers,\\nwhich does not require any connection between ledgers thanks to “cross-chain atomic\\nswaps,” which can help ensure interoperability between ledgers. Cross-ledger DvP ar-\\nrangements on DLT can be complex and can give rise to additional challenges that would\\nneed to be addressed. Legal aspects, which have not been part of this study, would need\\nto be further explored.\\n\\nStella Phase III: Synchronizing cross-border payments (June 2019)\\nFollowing the two previous phases, Project Stella examined how cross-border payments             55\\ncould be improved. “Cross-border payments are payments between currency areas\\nthat involve various entities across multiple jurisdictions. Compared with domestic pay-\\nments, they are often characterized as slow and costly”.\\nPhase III identified a new approach for settlement across ledgers through HTLC, which would\\npotentially “allow the mitigation of credit risks through the synchronization of settlements”.\\nThe BOJ and ECB conducted experiments involving synchronizing payments between DLT\\nledgers, between centralized ledgers, and between DLT and centralized ledgers.8\\nThe findings indicate that “only payment methods with an enforcement mechanism\\n[through a smart contract], either through the ledger itself or through a third party, can\\nensure that the transacting parties that completely satisfy their responsibilities in the\\ntransaction process are not exposed to the risk of incurring a loss on the principal amount\\nbeing transferred”. Although experiments applying a payment method with HTLC proved\\nthe technical feasibility of synchronized settlement between different types of ledgers,\\nfurther reflections on legal and compliance issues have been raised.\\n\\nStella Phase IV: Balancing confidentiality and auditability in a DLT environment\\nPhase IV focused itself on privacy-enhancing technologies/techniques (PETs) as chal-\\nlenges arise when auditing transactions in DLT-based financial market infrastructures,\\nwhile also limiting access to information by third parties to ensure the confidentiality of\\nthe payment system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                               Appendix One\\n\\x0c     Appendix Two:\\n     Regulatory Environment\\n     This appendix reviews in detail some of the regulatory environment related to\\n     blockchain in the United States and around the world.\\n\\n\\n     Regulatory Environment\\n     Blockchain technology has been subject to regulatory scrutiny, part of which seems\\n     to result from what the blockchain application offers as a product and the risks that it\\n     may circumvent applicable laws. Lack of familiarity with the blockchain technology will\\n     certainly lead to heightened scrutiny as we do not know whether the technology fulfills\\n     relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Still, it has also gained enough support to\\n     prompt regulators to either pass new laws, or attempt to fit blockchain technology devel-\\n     opments within existing legal frameworks.\\n     The clearest example of the latter is the way government authorities treat digital assets,\\n     e.g. Bitcoin, under their existing laws. In the United States, early initial coin offerings\\n     (ICOs), which offered retail investors the opportunity to invest in the development of new\\n     blockchain projects, raised the question of whether these fundraising projects could be\\n56   regulated by established securities laws. The United States Securities and Exchange\\n     Commission (SEC) was slow to act on this question, but eventually took a step toward\\n     answering the question in the affirmative by bringing enforcement actions under existing\\n     securities laws against startup companies offering ICOs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cIt is illegal to sell a security in the United States unless the security is registered with\\nthe SEC or is exempt from registration. The definition of “security” is set forth in the\\nSecurities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Generally, the courts\\nhave applied a four-part test to determine whether investment contracts are securities:\\nwhether the arrangement involves: (i) an investment of money; (ii) a common enterprise;\\n(iii) the expectation of profits; and (iv) the expectation of profits is to be derived from the\\nefforts of others. If these elements are present, the arrangement is a security and must\\neither be registered with the SEC or be exempt from registration.\\nThe SEC has applied this established test to digital assets. It proceeded to bring en-\\nforcement actions against Airfox and Paragon, two start-up companies, for failing to\\nregister their ICOs as securities under federal law. The companies settled the charges\\nand agreed to register the securities, pay a fine and return money to investors. The SEC\\nsettled another enforcement action with EtherDelta, a token trading platform, soon\\nthereafter. It was the SEC’s first action “based on findings that [the] platform operated\\nas an unregistered national securities exchange.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                  57\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese examples show that regulators will apply existing legal frameworks to regulate\\nBlockchain based on the nature of the product being offered. Accordingly, developers\\nand practitioners must consult existing laws in the relevant industry before adopting\\nblockchain technology solutions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                                Appendix Two\\n\\x0c     On the other hand, and apart from being subject to existing legal frameworks, Blockchain\\n     technology also has the potential to enhance an industry’s ability to comply with applica-\\n     ble regulations. In the area of healthcare, the Health Insurance Portability and Account-\\n     ability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulates the United States healthcare industry. Among other\\n     provisions, the law codified the Privacy Rule, which governs the use and disclosure of pa-\\n     tient health information (known as “protected health information” or PHI), and sets stan-\\n     dards for patients to understand and control how their PHI is used. Blockchain technology\\n     can be used to great effect to enhance compliance with the Privacy Rule. As others have\\n     noted, a patient’s identity and records could be stored on a private, permissioned block-\\n     chain and private keys could be used to transfer data or information in a secure manner.\\n     In addition to fitting blockchain technology applications in existing legal frameworks, a\\n     number of United States jurisdictions have passed blockchain-specific laws that aim to\\n     encourage the adoption and use of blockchain within their borders. The following is a\\n     summary of laws that are at the forefront of this rapidly developing area:\\n\\n       ARIZONA: In 2017, Arizona passed HB 2417, which allows the use of smart contracts in\\n       commerce and prohibited contracts from being denied legal validity because the con-\\n       tract contains a smart contract term. The bill recognizes records secured using block-\\n       chain as valid records under state law. Tennessee passed similar legislation in 2018.\\n\\n       DELAWARE: Thanks to its business-friendly laws, more than half of publicly traded\\n       companies in the United States are incorporated in Delaware. Accordingly, Delaware\\n58     took an early interest in incorporating blockchain developments into its existing corpo-\\n       rate laws. In 2017, it amended its general corporation law to allow companies to maintain\\n       their corporate records, including stock ledgers, using blockchain technology.\\n\\n       VERMONT: In 2018, Vermont was the first in the country to allow blockchain-based lim-\\n       ited liability companies (BBLLC). The idea, similar to traditional limited liability compa-\\n       nies, is to allow companies that use blockchain technology as a material part of their\\n       business activities to protect its members from legal liability. A BBLLC may customize\\n       its governance structure using blockchain technology and validate and store records on\\n       a blockchain. The Act also directed Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation to ex-\\n       plore the use of blockchain technology in different industries and to identify regulatory\\n       changes that would allow blockchain to be adopted in those industries.\\n\\n       WYOMING: In 2019, Wyoming was one of the first states to adopt a series of block-\\n       chain-friendly measures aimed at bringing blockchain business to the nation’s least\\n       populous state. Wyoming laws: (i) create an exception from state securities laws for\\n       blockchain tokens; (ii) make virtual currency exempt from money transmitter rules;\\n       (iii) recognize distributed-ledger-based corporate recordkeeping; (iv) exempt virtual\\n       currency from property taxes; and (v) recognize a form of limited liability company (the\\n       “series” LLC) conducive to blockchain businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0cIn addition, various United States jurisdictions have launched their own projects to ex-\\nplore the use of blockchain, rather than simply regulate its usage by private actors.\\nThe states of Delaware, Illinois, and Colorado, among others, have launched initiatives\\nto shift state records to distributed ledgers. More broadly, in 2019, nearly every state\\nin the US had a blockchain-related bill sponsored and introduced to the legislature,\\nproving that this rapidly evolving area needs continuous monitoring to keep pace with\\nchanging regulations.\\nGlobally, a number of countries have raced to court blockchain business by creating or\\namending regulatory frameworks:\\n\\n MALTA: Also known as “Blockchain Island,” this small island nation in the Mediter-\\n ranean adopted a “complete regulatory framework” in 2018, which was “designed\\n to make Malta one of the most desirable locations to set up shop in the blockchain\\n space.”The laws established the Malta Digital Innovation Authority, certified DLT plat-\\n forms, set up exchanges and other companies in the cryptocurrency market, and es-\\n tablished a regulatory regime governing cryptocurrency and ICOs.\\n SWITZERLAND: This European nation known for its banking and finance industries\\n recently amended several existing laws to accommodate blockchain technology devel-\\n opments. Among other things, the amendments establish a legal basis for exchanging\\n digital securities and for recovering digital assets from bankrupt companies.\\n LICHTENSTEIN: Lichtenstein passed new laws and amended existing laws in order to\\n allow rights and assets to become tokenized, thereby allowing the development of the       59\\n so-called token economy.\\n UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE): In 2018, the UAE announced the Emirate Block-\\n chain Strategy 2021, a plan to shift at least 50 percent of government-related trans-\\n actions to DLT platforms by 2021. The country’s ambitious effort, expected to greatly\\n increase efficiencies through reduced transaction costs, work hours and resource use,\\n is a novel approach to incorporating blockchain-based solutions into everyday life.\\n Specific projects include using blockchain technology for logistics and to record land\\n ownership. The country was an early leader in regulating businesses operating using\\n Blockchain technology, issuing guidelines for ICOs in 2017 and establishing an author-\\n ity to regulate digital assets.\\n JAPAN: Despite high-profile hacks in Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges, Japan\\n encourages blockchain technology through constantly evolving laws and regulations.\\n Since 2016, Japan has officially recognized cryptocurrency as legal tender and there-\\n by regulates cryptocurrency under its financial regulatory authority. The generally\\n friendly blockchain environment has encouraged Japanese exchanges to self-regu-\\n late, which allows them to quickly respond to evolving security threats such as hacks.\\n Following perhaps inevitable conflict between exchanges and anti-money laundering\\n policies, however, Japan recently banned privacy coin trading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlockchain Interoperability\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                                          Appendix Two\\n\\x0c         SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was an early regulator of\\n         cryptocurrency. MAS’s approach is to “regulate the space to prevent stifling innovation,\\n         while simultaneously protecting investors and the public at large.” MAS is participat-\\n         ing in Project Ubin, which creates a digital token for the Singapore dollar on Ethereum.\\n         Singapore recently passed the Payment Services Act, which streamlines regulations\\n         for payment services, including cryptocurrency and exchange services. Payment ser-\\n         vice providers required to obtain licenses must meet anti-money laundering and coun-\\n         tering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements. MAS has issued AML/CFT\\n         guidelines specific to digital payment token services.\\n\\n     The opportunities behind digital inclusion have also created a need for development or-\\n     ganizations with a focus on economic development and trade to establish agile tech-\\n     nology-specialist teams. These teams have become privy to deliver concise advice on\\n     technology matters in various disciplines: business, economics, legal, and technical.\\n     Examples of these teams include the World Bank Group Technology & Innovation Lab,\\n     the IMF’s Digital Advisory Unit, IDB (IDB Lab). Other intergovernmental organizations\\n     working to promote economic cooperation, such as OECD (Blockchain Policy Forum),\\n     WEF (Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution), as well as the European Commission\\n     (Blockchain Observatory), have dedicated many working groups to research how growth\\n     can flourish through future technological developments. Many of these working groups\\n     strive to produce knowledge pieces for the public to evaluate and inspire the activities of\\n     these innovation teams. In addition, international conferences are regularly to capture\\n60   the various learnings being carried out in various institutions. Nevertheless, there is no\\n     universal standard for Blockchain applications that could potentially facilitate interop-\\n     erability at the moment. Such a space is open for exploration, development, and in need\\n     of leadership to pave the way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     ENDNOTES\\n     1    \\x07 uthored by the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, HSBC\\n          A\\n          and a group of other commercial banks in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Singapore https:/ /www.\\n          mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/ProjectUbin/Cross-Border-Interbank-Payments-and-Settlements.pdf\\n       \\x07 ttps:/\\n     2 h       /www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/ProjectUbin/Jasper-Ubin-Design-Paper.pd-\\n       f?la=en&hash=437222C94FD39314FB4C685EA31FC3AAA5CA5DA1\\n     3 https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/29-Sep-17/jasper_report_eng.pdf\\t\\n       \\x07 ayments Canada (2017) “A Canadian Experiment with Distributed Ledger Technology for Domestic\\n     4 P\\n       Interbank Payments Settlement”\\n       \\x07 nternational Monetary Fund (2019) “FinTech in Sub-Saharan African Countries: A Game Changer?”\\n     5 I\\n       \\x07 ttps:/\\n     6 h       /www.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/sg/Documents/financial-services/sg-fsi-project-\\n       ubin-report.pdf\\n     7 https://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/release_2018/data/rel180327a1.pdf\\n     8 https://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/release_2019/data/rel190604a1.pdf\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     WBG ITS Technology & Innovation Lab\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c', metadata={'source': 'data/Blockchain.txt'})]"

Internet protocols,\\n     such as TCP/IP and APIs, have set good examples of achieving data interoperability. How-\\n     ever, value transfer has been an application-layer concern, and not a protocol-level concern\\n     in the traditional Internet context. With blockchain becoming the “Internet of Value”,24 en-\\n     suring the integrity of value transfer across different blockchains has become a problem to\\n     address at the foundation layer, and also needs to be considered at the blockchain network\\n     protocol level as well. In addition, there are attempts to create interoperability among dif-\\n     ferent blockchains at the middleware level, e.g., blockchain-agnostic smart contracts, e.g.\\n     DAML by Digital Asset Holdings, or Quant Network’s multi-blockchain DApps (MApps).\\n\\n\\n     23   \\x07Inclusive Deployment of Blockchain for Supply Chains: Part 6 – A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability:\\n          http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_Framework_for_Blockchain_Interoperability_2020.pdf\\n     24   Ripple. 2019. “The Internet of Value: What It Means and How It Benefits Everyone.” October 25.

To achieve better resiliency and to increase trust, or-\\n acles can adopt a decentralized architecture in the same manner as Chainlink.\\n\\n In a notary scheme, one or more trusted nodes agree to carry out an action on chain B\\n when some event on chain A happens (Buterin, 2016). Trusted nodes are the key to no-\\n tary schemes. One important feature of the notary scheme is its atomicity, meaning that\\n a transaction needs to be all or nothing for all participants. The notary scheme has been\\n implemented in the Atomic mode of the Interledger Protocol25 , whereby an ad hoc group\\n of notaries are selected to support the execution of each payment by confirming the suc-\\n cess or failure of the payment.', metadata={'source': 'data/Blockchain.txt'}),\n",

This group will also manage the data standard of interoperability, such\\n     as smart contract, entities and digital assets.23 This governance model could help to estab-\\n     lish a business partnership, which is not constricted by technological limitations.\\n\\n\\n     The Technology Perspective\\n          So far, the notion of chain interoperability has seen much theory and little practice,\\n          primarily because a live example of successful chain interoperability requires not one,\\n          but two, already existing, stable and sufficiently powerful blockchains to build off, but\\n          this is slowly starting to change. -Vitalik Buterin (2016).\\n18\\n     Technology Approaches\\n     Technically, blockchain interoperability seeks to achieve one fundamental goal, namely\\n     ensuring the integrity of both information exchanges (data exchange among business sys-\\n     tems) and value transfers (digital assets exchange, e.g. crypto, tokens). Internet protocols,\\n     such as TCP/IP and APIs, have set good examples of achieving data interoperability. How-\\n     ever, value transfer has been an application-layer concern, and not a protocol-level concern\\n     in the traditional Internet context. With blockchain becoming the “Internet of Value”,24 en-\\n     suring the integrity of value transfer across different blockchains has become a problem to\\n     address at the foundation layer, and also needs to be considered at the blockchain network\\n     protocol level as well. In addition, there are attempts to create interoperability among dif-\\n     ferent blockchains at the middleware level, e.g., blockchain-agnostic smart contracts, e.g.\\n     DAML by Digital Asset Holdings, or Quant Network’s multi-blockchain DApps (MApps).\\n\\n\\n     23   \\x07Inclusive Deployment of Blockchain for Supply Chains: Part 6 – A Framework for Blockchain Interoperability:\\n          http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_A_Framework_for_Blockchain_Interoperability_2020.pdf\\n     24   Ripple. 2019. “The Internet of Value: What It Means and How It Benefits Everyone.” October 25.

Oracles and Notaries\\n Oracles and notaries are trusted agents between different blockchains, or between a\\n blockchain and the off-chain world. To achieve better resiliency and to increase trust, or-\\n acles can adopt a decentralized architecture in the same manner as Chainlink.\\n\\n In a notary scheme, one or more trusted nodes agree to carry out an action on chain B\\n when some event on chain A happens (Buterin, 2016). Trusted nodes are the key to no-\\n tary schemes. One important feature of the notary scheme is its atomicity, meaning that\\n a transaction needs to be all or nothing for all participants. The notary scheme has been\\n implemented in the Atomic mode of the Interledger Protocol25 , whereby an ad hoc group\\n of notaries are selected to support the execution of each payment by confirming the suc-\\n cess or failure of the payment.', metadata={'source': 'data/Blockchain.txt'})]"
